Rack::Timeout
=============

Abort requests that are taking too long; a Timeout::Error will be raised.


Usage
-----

### Rails 3 app or Rails 2.3 app with Ruby 1.9 and Bundler

    # Gemfile
    gem "rack-timeout"

### Rails 3 app or Rails 2.3 app with Ruby 1.8 and Bundler

    # Gemfile
    gem "SystemTimer", :require => "system_timer", :platforms => :ruby_18
    gem "rack-timeout"


### Rails 2.3 app without Bundler

    # config/environment.rb
    config.gem "SystemTimer", :lib => "system_timer" if RUBY_VERSION < "1.9"
    config.gem "rack-timeout"


### Sinatra and other Rack apps

    # config.ru
    require "rack/timeout"
    use Rack::Timeout           # call as early as possible so rack-timeout runs before other middlewares.
    Rack::Timeout.timeout = 10  # this line is optional. if omitted, default is 15 seconds.

### Setting a custom timeout for Rails apps

    # config/initializers/timeout.rb
    Rack::Timeout.timeout = 10  # seconds


### Here be dragons

SystemTimer/timeout rely on threads. If your app or any of the libraries it depends on is not thread-safe,
you may run into issues using rack-timeout.

Concurrent web servers such as [Unicorn][] and [Puma][] should work fine with rack-timeout.

If you're trying to test that a `Timeout::Error` is being raised in your Rails application, please note that it's **not possible in functional tests**. You *can* `assert_raises Timeout::Error` in integration tests by adding the following to your `test_helper.rb`

    # test/test_helper.rb
    ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest.app = Rack::Builder.new do
      eval File.read(Rails.root.join('config.ru'))
    end
